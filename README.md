# ARPG-Z-Project
An ARPG unreal engine template project used as a base for ARPG projects. This pack will be open source allowing anyone to use it. I intend to use this pack to create another full game project after completion of this pack.

I will slowly add to the documentation first, designing each system with great detail. Once im happy with it in completion, i will start developing the project in Unreal Engine 5.4 (may change if new features in later versions appeal to me).
